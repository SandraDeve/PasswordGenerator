Password Generator

# Overview

The purpose of this task was to apply our previous lessons in a practical setting by developing an application that generates a secure password based on user-specified criteria using JavaScript.

I have been provided with the starter code. I had tutoring session regarding this project and explain in details about spread syntax, isNaN() function, Math random and math floor and I used as a quide following sources:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/isNaN
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor

The primary focus was on JavaScript, while the HTML and CSS were left untouched.

The project had several requirements that had to be met, including:

- Generating a password by clicking a button
- Presenting a series of prompts for password criteria
- Determining the length of the password, which must be at least 8 characters long but no more than 128.
- Specifying character types, such as lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters ($@%&\*, etc.).
- Validating the input for each criterion, and at least one character type must be selected
- Generating the password once the prompts are answered and displaying it in an alert or writing it to the page.

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

# Usage

This repository includes the core files and folder related to the tasks, with comments added to key sections of the code to explain their purpose and expected outcome. The interface is straighforward and easy to use: simply click the button to start, follow the prompts, and refresh the page to start over.
